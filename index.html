          <div class="post-content">
            <p>If someone would have told me 23 years ago when I had re-awoken in this flesh prison that I would have to re-do humanity again, i would have <strong>lept directly out the hospital window</strong> and headed back to my eternal home in <em>Ja's</em> arms. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I was re-birthed onto this hell orb as an infant and did not have the programmed motor skills to propel myself from my mother's arms onto the cold concrete beneath Room 107 at Peel Hospital in NY.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I often wonder what our lord's mother felt like when she gave birth to the king. I wondered what feelings she felt as she realized she was raising a savior.</p>
            <p>I didn't have to wonder for long. When I gave birth to little Post Malone, I simply knew he was from somewhere else. He had a look in his eyes of <strong>deep, deep desire</strong> to commit suicide. My beautiful, brand-new, infant son longing to end his suffering once again in the simulation. It was a lot for a mother to take on. </p>

              <p>Look, straight up I wasn't around this little gremlin when he was growing up.</p>
              <p>I don't really give a s%#& that he's an ancient alien because like I said, I never really knew the lil dummy. I know he make garbage rap-country music for white teens now, so that's solid. Also, I knew he be like ducks in a pond rolling in dat bread.</p>
